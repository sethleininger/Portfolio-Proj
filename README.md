# Portfolio-Project

## Description

This is a personal website for a my portfolio.

For HTML:
I added Header/Footer and three internal sections to the page
In the header is my my name and links to sections of the page.
First section bleow that is a picture of me with "Web Developer" Header.
Second section is an about me with quick blurb of my background and hobbies.
Third section is a section that shows what work i have accomplished (only one real one) pictures were added to the other three with no external links.
Last section is footer and is my Contact section that includes my email/phone number and links to my music sites.
I put a lot of time adding artistry to the page.

For CSS:
I spent most of my time on the styles sheet adding as much to the headers and look of the page to make it pleasing to the eye while still being functional.
Hover componets were added to all links.

Fonts and colors are universal for the page.
Media queries were added so page is funtional for all devices.

## Usage 

Just load the html on your page or go to the deployed page!
